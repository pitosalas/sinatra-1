### Developers Notebook
#### Example from Book
##### Differences
  * In my code I had trouble getting rspec to work, so I have switched to minitest/spec.

#### Gems

Notice that because versions have changed, I've changed the test framework from rspec to minitest/spec. My code in this library therefore does not reflect whats in the book exactly.


* gem install rack
* gem install sinatra
* gem install json
* gem install activerecord
* gem install typhoeus
* gem install pry
